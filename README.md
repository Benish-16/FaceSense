# FaceSense
<h1>Descrption:</h1>
<p>This project integrates multiple advanced features of computer vision to enhance facial recognition and detection. Utilizing the OpenCV library, it captures real-time video input from a webcam. It then employs Dlib's face detector for smile detection. The script also uses the face_recognition library to recognize known individuals by matching their facial encodings against pre-loaded images. Moreover, it incorporates a blink detection mechanism using the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to differentiate between live and static (potentially fake) faces. This functionality can be critical in security applications, where it's essential to confirm the liveness of a detected face. Additionally, the script detects smiles, providing a user-friendly interface by indicating when someone is smiling in the camera's view. This combination of features—real-time facial recognition, blink detection, and smile detection—makes the script highly versatile, suitable for applications ranging from secure access systems to interactive digital experiences.</p>
